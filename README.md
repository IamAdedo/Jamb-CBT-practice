## **📌 Why This Project Matters**  
Every year, **millions of Nigerian students fail JAMB UTME** due to:  
- **Lack of CBT familiarity** (many have never used a computer before the exam).  
- **Limited access to quality practice platforms** (most are expensive or outdated).  
- **Exam malpractice reliance** (students trust "Expo" over actual preparation).  

This project aims to:  
✅ **Democratize JAMB prep**—free, open-source, and accessible to all.  
✅ **Mimic the real exam interface**—so students gain confidence.  
✅ **Track progress**—highlight weaknesses and improve performance.  

🔹 **For generations to come**: This isn’t just an app—it’s a **movement** to fix education through technology.
